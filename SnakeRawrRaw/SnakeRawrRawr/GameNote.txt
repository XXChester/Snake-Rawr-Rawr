====================
	OBJECTIVE
====================
I was bored and needed a break from writing all of my companies infrastructure and I also was waiting on a contract to be signed and returned and had an itching
for some game development. So I had to pick something really simple becuase I didn't have a lot of time....Snake it is. Also my friend "Carebear Truscello" was
begging for an appearance so, here it is.


====================
	CORE
====================
[*]Model objects
[*]Render snake
[*]Implement snake movement
[*]Render board
[*]State machine
[*]Implement collection of nodes which make snake grow
[*]Implement the ability to die
[*]Implement a HUD that tracks the score
[*]2 player



====================
	POLISH
====================
[*]Multiple nodes
[*]Regular node spawn effect
[*]Regular node idle animation
[*]Regular node death effect
[*]Rare node spawn effect
[*]Rare node idle animation
[*]Rare node idle particles
[*]Rare node death effect
[*]Head animation
[*]Body animation
[*]Tail animation
[*]HUD text pulse animation
[*]SFK
[*]Music
[*]Portals Functional
[*]Portals SFX
[*]Redo portal sprites
[*]Random wall generation
[*]Random wall generation sfx
[*]New generation algorithm based on the current display to prevent overlapping spawns
[*]Snake corner pieces so its not jaggad
[*]Death animations fade out
[*]Countdown to start HUD
[*]Main Menu
[*]Options Menu
	[*]Sliders for Music & SFX
	[*]Configurable keys
[*]Transitions
[*]HUD countdown SFXs
[*]In two player a "winner" tag under the score of the player that won

====================
	BUGS
====================
[*]We are loosing space on the pivot points with the children nodes...gaps appear in the snake
[*]2Player sound listeners aren't working, only 2nd player is listening
[*]Portal spawn is blarring and completely ignoring the emitter when the game is waiting, once the game is active it respects the emitter
[*]All sprites are shown in their initial stage, on count down...should be hidden
[*]SFX Emitter's leaking
[*]Weird scenario where If you turn in a portal you can loose some nodes
[*]Lingering sounds effects, specifically the portals
[*]2 Player is crashing due to the sound engine
[*]If you hit escape mid transition of the cinematic it flashes full on first then transitions out
[*]If you hit escape twice the transition out restarts (see Options screen)
